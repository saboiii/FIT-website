// Shared creator shell for every /dashboard/* route (blueprint §5.1): one
// rail + canvas layout provider instead of a per-page copy. This layout is a
// server component; CreatorShell is the client boundary. Auth stays where it
// was — each page keeps its own Clerk/subscription gating client-side (home
// via DashboardPage, product create/edit via useAccess, messages via
// entitlements), so the shell renders for any signed-in state and the gated
// pages swap their own content for Fallback inside the rail.
