// Guided-tour content (blueprint §9.11) — panelKey → CoachMarks steps.
// Adding a tour is DATA, not code: write plain-language copy that answers
// "what is this and why do I care", point each step at a stable
// `data-tour="…"` attribute in the panel, and mount `<CoachMarks />` with
// the panel's key. Steps whose selector isn't on screen are skipped
// automatically (e.g. cards that only render in a certain sub-view).
